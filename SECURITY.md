# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

`github-backup-rs` is pre-`1.0.0`. Security fixes are prioritized on the latest commit on the default branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

Preferred process:

1. Open a private GitHub Security Advisory (if enabled on the repository).
2. If private advisories are unavailable, contact maintainers directly using private contact details listed on the repository profile.

When reporting, include:

- affected version or commit
- reproduction steps or proof of concept
- impact assessment
- suggested remediation (optional)

You can expect acknowledgment as soon as possible, followed by triage and remediation updates.
